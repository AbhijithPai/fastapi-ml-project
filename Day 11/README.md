# 🚀 MLOps Sentiment Analysis API — Progress Update (Day 11)
Time: 1 hours

## ✅ What I Improved Today

### 🧠 Model-Side Enhancements
- Improved sentiment classification model
- Stable **training → evaluation → inference** pipeline
- Verified metrics on a large real-world dataset (positive / negative / neutral)

### ⚙️ Production-Ready API Upgrades
- Added **request logging middleware**  
  → Logs method, path, status code, and response time
- Implemented **/health** endpoint  
  → Confirms API server is alive
- Implemented **/ready** endpoint  
  → Confirms model is loaded and ready for inference

### 🧩 Clean MLOps Architecture
- Training logic fully separated from inference
- Model artifacts handled outside API runtime
- API focused only on serving predictions

## 📌 Why This Matters
These upgrades move the project from *“just an ML API”* to a **real MLOps-style service** that is:
- Observable
- Deployable
- Production-aligned

📅 **Day 11 completed** — MLOps foundation done.  
➡️ Ready to transition into **LLMOps** next.
