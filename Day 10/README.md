⭐ MLOps API — Day 10 Progress

Time: 3 hours

Today’s work focused on building the ML side of the project and connecting it cleanly with the API.

✔ What I built today

Added training pipeline (train.py)

Added evaluation pipeline (evaluate.py)

Added preprocessing pipeline (preprocess.py)

Added inference pipeline (predict.py)

Used a twitter sentiment dataset from Kaggle

Generated model + vectorizer artifacts

Organized everything into a clean MLOps-style structure

API prepared to connect with real model inference

✔ What’s next

Connect inference cleanly with FastAPI routes

Add version tracking for trained models

Improve metrics & monitoring setup

This completes Day 10 and sets the foundation for a proper ML workflow inside the project
